      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am currently a Product Engineer at Burndy LLC with a BS in Mechancial Engineering from UNH.
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the Seacoast of New Hampshire. Born and Portsmouth and rasied in Newmarket.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy rock climbing, playing disc golf, and bowling. For the past couple of years I've been a regular participant in Spartan Races and I look forward to attempting my first triatholon this August. When I'm not outside I enjoy watching sports and playing with my pet rabbit (Oakley) and hamster (Samson). In the future I'm hoping to teach myself more about PLC programming and to begin  tinkering with electronics/electro-mechanical systems.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I think I'd like to work with sensor arrays/PLC's. Something that would require with both software and hardware. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Dover, NH.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd like to be Web Devloper because no engineer has as much versatility and control as a software engineer. It's very much a full circle skill set in the sense that with just a computer and internet access you're able to design, test, and implment full projects/creations. And beyond that, the skill sets gained from learning Web Development are applicable to almost any other discipline.</p>
